Each point is based upon the prior year, hence the \"difference\" means either the new year gained more winning points or lost winning points. What this data tells us is that there is no discernable trend between win points gained or win points lost. In general, this chart is useful for showing variation with fixed points, including positive and negative values. Thus demonstrating how measures may change over time. As we can see, over the course of 3 decades, the difference in win points starting at a baseline of 0 changes drastically."
